## Description
The LASB(Leo, Adam, and Sarvesh Banking) system is a banking management application. The system is going to be focused on easy-to-use formatting of various actions that customers/employees can perform on certain accounts. The LASB System will eliminate the need for manual, tedious processes in banking. Such actions include checking account balances, transferring funds, applying for loans, approving/denying loans(a tellers-specific function), etc. The main goal of this application is to provide an efficient way for customers and employees to carry out their banking needs, allowing both bankers and customers to save time. The LASB System will be available as a web application, accessible through any internet browser,
